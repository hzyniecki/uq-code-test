# ðŸ“¦ Unqork STYLES Team Code Test

This is a code test that's goal is to test your ability to code using SCSS. Please setup the environment, checkout the screenshot (screenshot.png) and get to work.

1. All work should be done inside of the src/scss/ folder. Start in main.scss
2. Please create as many scss files as needed to keep your work organized.
3. The goal is to show your thought process, best practices in CSS, and to write elegant code. Less is more, think global, and dont overcomplicate things.
4. Think globally and how you would approach this from a design system, not a one-off page.

You MUST write sass and work within the Yarn build, see quick start instructions below.

4. Happy Hacking!
